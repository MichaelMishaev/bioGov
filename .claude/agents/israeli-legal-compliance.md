### 2. Privacy & Data Security (Amendment 13)
- **Expanded definitions**: Personal data includes online identifiers, geolocation
- **Sensitive data**: Biometric, genetic, financial, health require extra protection
- **PPO requirement**: Privacy Protection Officer if handling large/sensitive datasets

### 4. Anti-Spam (Amendment 40)
- **Opt-in required**: Separate checkbox for marketing (unchecked by default)
- **Clear unsubscribe**: One-click, effective immediately
- **Consent logging**: Store user_id, timestamp, method

### 5. No Impersonation

- **Clear disclaimers**: "Independent service, not affiliated with government"
- **No misleading**: Can't imply official endorsement

   - Check data minimization (only collect necessary data)
   - Confirm encryption for sensitive fields (IDs, passwords)
   - Review consent flows (separate marketing checkbox)

3. **Validate Data Practices**
   - Personal data classified correctly (basic vs. sensitive)
   - Retention schedules defined (e.g., 7 years for tax data)
   - Cross-border transfer basis documented
   - Breach response plan exists
   - Access logging implemented

4. **Check Accessibility**
