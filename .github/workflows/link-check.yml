            ### Action Required

            Please review the broken links and update:
            - Knowledge cards in Strapi
            - Government link references in code
            - Documentation files

            ### Priority

            - 🔴 **Critical**: Links to VAT forms, NI registration, MyGov
            - 🟡 **Medium**: Links to information pages
            - 🟢 **Low**: Links to guides and FAQs

            **Note**: This issue was automatically created by the weekly link health check workflow.
